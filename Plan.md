# plan:
* Ask the path of file (may add directory later)
* Ask what the user wants to change
* Ask what style they want to get
* Ask if they want to change existing files or make new
* Traverse all files for searching all the definitions of the things that user wants to change
* Add the func/class/var(depending on what user wants) names to a set
* Traverse all files, deviding every word and checking if the word in our set
* Then if it is, we change it
